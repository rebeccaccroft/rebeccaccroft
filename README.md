### Hello! 👋

I'm Rebecca, and I am a newly minted full stack software engineer/ web developer. I have worked with Java, Javascript, and Python as well as a host of other frameworks, databases and design tools. I am a native of the greater Seattle area. Bonus points if you know the restaurant from which this photo was taken!
